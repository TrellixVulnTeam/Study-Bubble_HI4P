This application was created using Python Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

•	Backend was handled using Flask and Python. 
•	GET requests queried a database to find and display specific posts while POST requests updated the database with new objects or modified an existing entry. Used SQLAlchemy for database functionality.
•	Wrote front-end in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Used template inheritance to minimize code and allow block overriding.
